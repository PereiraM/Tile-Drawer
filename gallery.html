            Run your own OpenStreetMap server in the cloud with one-step configuration and zero administration. <i style="white-space: nowrap;">Tile Drawer</i> is a product of <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design’s</a> <a href="http://mike.teczno.com">Michal Migurski</a>.

        <h2>Map Styles</h2>
        <p>
            A few basic styles are provided here for use with <i>Tile Drawer</i>. If this thing takes off, I’d like to add more custom cartography from other designers. <a href="mailto:info@tiledrawer.com">E-mail me</a> for more info!
        </p>

        <h3>Bright</h3>
        <p>
            This is the style that ships with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/wiki/Cascadenik">Cascadenik</a>, <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/cascadenik-openstreetmap.html">originally designed in late 2008</a> to test software and experiment with OpenStreetMap data. It’s largely primary colors, and has definitions for a variety of scales. Because residential roads are used for texture even at small scales, you’ll find that this style is slow to render at lower, city-wide zoom levels. The road widths defined here later informed <a href="http://stamen.com/clients/cloudmade">Stamen’s design work for Cloudmade</a>.

        <h3>Scratch</h3>
        <p>
            This demonstration style was produced for the <a href="http://mapsfromscratch.com/">Where 2.0 Maps From Scratch workshop</a>, where Stamen colleague Shawn Allen and I showed how to generate road cartography from raw data and first principles. <i>Scratch</i> is designed to work at just a few scales, and as a demonstration style it lacks certain key features such as points of interest and water bodies. It is, however, simple and self-contained, and can be considered a solid starting point for further design.
